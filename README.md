## Introduction

The project aim for general analysis present in anime world, Data was collected from Anilist, a website for anime and
manga enthusiasts, and analyzed using various statistical techniques.

For example analyzing the relationship between the ages of voice actors and the ages of the characters they voice in
anime media. It was found that there is a correlation between the ages of voice actors and the ages of the characters
they voice, with voice actors generally voicing characters who are around 10 years younger than them.

The study also explored the relationship between the ages of voice actors and the size of the media production, finding
that smaller media productions tend to have voice actors with more similar ages, while larger productions have a greater
range of ages among their voice actors.

Additional features were implemented to allow for the visualization and exploration of the data, including the ability
to view the details of specific voice actors and their roles in the various media productions.
